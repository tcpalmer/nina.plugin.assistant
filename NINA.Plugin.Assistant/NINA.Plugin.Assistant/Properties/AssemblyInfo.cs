[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("LongDescription", @"The Target Scheduler Plugin is designed to provide a higher level of automation than is typically achievable with NINA. Specifically, it maintains a database of imaging projects describing DSO targets and associated exposure plans. Based on various criteria and preferences, it can decide at any given time what project/target should be actively imaging. A user will enter the desired projects, targets, and preferences into a UI exposed by the plugin. At runtime, a single new instruction for the NINA Advanced Sequencer will interact with the planning engine to determine the best target for imaging at each point throughout a night. The instruction will manage the slew/center to the target, switching filters, taking exposures, and dithering - all while transparently interacting with the surrounding NINA triggers and conditions.

## Major Features
* Easy to use interface for entering and managing projects, targets, and exposure plans
* Multiple target import options: NINA catalog, NINA Framing Assistant (including mosaic panels), attached planetarium programs, Telescopius CSV, and more
* Dynamic target selection based on visibility and weighted scoring rules
* Flexible exposure/filter planning including enhanced moon avoidance
* Plan previewing
* Image grading
* Automated flats support
* Synchronization across multiple instances of NINA
* Support for 24x7 sequences for long term unattended operation

## Documentation
The [plugin documentation](https://tcpalmer.github.io/nina-scheduler/) provides a detailed description of the plugin and how to use it.  See the [release notes](https://tcpalmer.github.io/nina-scheduler/release.html) for changes in recent versions.

## Acknowledgements
* Chris Woodhouse has been involved since the beginning and was instrumental in hashing out the initial design and requirements.
* Matt Nudi also provided design feedback and critical early beta testing.
* Linda Thomas-Fowler and Chris Kagy continue to provide invaluable testing and feedback on features.
* The concept for the plugin was originally inspired by the AIC video [Tim Hutchison: Automating a Backyard Observatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4IkAUZkXH0).
* Any automated scheduler is going to owe a debt of gratitude to [ACP](https://acpx.dc3.com/) for pioneering in this area.
* Finally, it's a tribute to the elegant design of NINA and the Advanced Sequencer that a plugin of this type is not only possible, but can also interact correctly with other elements in a sequence.
